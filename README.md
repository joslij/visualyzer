# Visualyzer
The application will give visual insights of popular places, animals, emotions, etc. (to be continued...). 
It can also be used to upload your favorite visuals and get insights on them as well. 

# **Disclaimer**
The application uses [Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services - Computer Vision](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/) to analyze the images. According to Microsoft, they do not store your uploaded images or videos after they are analyzed:  
```
Microsoft automatically deletes your images and videos after processing and doesn’t train on your data to enhance the underlying models. Video data doesn’t leave your premises, and video data isn’t stored on the edge where the container runs. 
```
It is recommended that you read their [privacy policy](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/support/legal/cognitive-services-compliance-and-privacy/).
